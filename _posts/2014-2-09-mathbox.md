[MathBox][] Available for Download

Download this [Text][] too.


Put the MathBox and the "mathwords.txt" in the same location. 

The MathBox will grab the "mathwords" text file and scan it.

This will allow you to use a set of predefined keywords, and those keywords will be converted into other words or characters. 

I called this "MathBox" because I used it to make my math homework easier to write on a computer.
