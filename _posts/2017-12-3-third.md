What do I want to do with my life?

If you haven't answered that question, then you aren't alive.

If you wish to find an answer to that question, here is my advice:
1. Do NOT let someone else decide the answer for you.  If they try, bluntly tell them to fuck off.
2. Allow introspection to drive your decision.
3. Don't worry about "contributing to the greater good" or "performing to the best of your ability".
4. You do you.
