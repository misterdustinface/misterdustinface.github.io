================

I have learned things.

Jekyll is a ruby-based thingy that turns all bad things into magical text.
It forceably makes you set up a template system, but the system MAKES SENSE (and of course sets a standard).

Hence, we have some sort of a "forced modularization" that gives us epic constructive functionality for any and all pages.
