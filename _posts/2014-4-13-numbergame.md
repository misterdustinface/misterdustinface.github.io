title:  Number Game Prototype
---

{{ page.title }}
================

[Numbers][] Available for Download for any computer that can run GL20 (it's a graphics thing - and it needs it at the moment because we used really wonky texture sizes for our prototype). 

A tile-based number game that is still in development. It will be released for android devices.

Team: Nick deWaide, Evan Palmer, Dustin Shaffer

Current Controls: W/A/S/D to move the cursor. Press spacebar to "flip" tiles. F5 makes a new board of the same size. Pressing a number key makes a board of that # size.
