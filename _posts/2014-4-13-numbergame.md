[Numbers][] Available for Download for any computer that can run GL20 (it's a graphics thing - and it needs it at the moment because we used really wonky texture sizes for our prototype).

<div class="paper">

A tile-based number game proof of concept demonstration.

Team: 
Nick deWaide, Evan Palmer, Dustin Shaffer

Controls: 
<li>W/A/S/D to move the cursor.</li>
<li>Press spacebar to "flip" tiles.</li>
<li>F5 makes a new board of the same size.</li>
<li>Pressing a number key makes a board of that # size.</li>

Flip: 
<li>Increments the number at the chosen tile, and decrements the numbers at the surrounding, touching tiles.</li>

Goal: 
<li>Match all the tiles!</li>
<li>We recommend starting on the 2x2, and then moving on to 3x3 boards.</li>
<li>Not all 4x4+ grids are solvable.</li>
