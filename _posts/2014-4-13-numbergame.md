[Numbers][] Available for Download for any computer that can run GL20 (it's a graphics thing - and it needs it at the moment because we used really wonky texture sizes for our prototype).

<div class="paper">
A tile-based number game proof of concept demonstration.

Team: 
Nick deWaide, Evan Palmer, Dustin Shaffer


Controls: 
W/A/S/D to move the cursor. 
Press spacebar to "flip" tiles. 
F5 makes a new board of the same size. 
Pressing a number key makes a board of that # size.


Flip: 
Increments the number at the chosen tile, and decrements the numbers at the surrounding, touching tiles.


Goal: 
Match all the tiles! 
We recommend starting on the 2x2, and then moving on to 3x3 boards. 
Not all 4x4+ grids are solvable.
