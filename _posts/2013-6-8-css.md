================

CSS is a pretty nifty language for making pleasant graphical user interfaces in html.

The website's theme is written in CSS.  
The "homebar" is made from a special portion of css theme code written under a certain specification ["#list-nav"] 
that I have defined ("list" because it utilizes lists, "nav" because it's a navigation bar).  

Some Notes on CSS
-----------------
1. When you use CSS code to define a theme, do so in the "header" portion of the page.

2. Make a backup "alternate" theme just in case your main theme doesn't work, or if you feel like changing your theme.
   Your page setup should be designed so you can change your theme at any given time without breaking your pages.
   
3. Try to put all your wanted CSS code into the singleton theme.css document (your generated themes should be all-encapsulating).
   For example, I had my homebar code (specific) and my theme code (general / taste-specific) separated at first (which was bad),
   so I decided to throw them both into the theme code - which kept my theme pretty general still (primarily just taste specific),
   but with an added element that made it into a basic "template" for any theme I could produce for this website.
