<div class="paper">
<li>When running MathBox, click "Options" -> "Select Keyword Set".</li>
<li>Find the mathwords.txt file. Click it, then click "open".</li>
<li>The MathBox will grab the mathwords.txt file and scan it.</li>
<li>This will allow you to use a set of predefined keywords, and those keywords will be converted into other words or characters, as determined by the file.</li>
<li>Select the "Convert" option, or press the F1 key on your keyboard, to seamlessly convert keywords.</li>
<li>I called this MathBox because I used it to make my math homework easier to write on a computer.</li>
<li>You can make your own Keyword Sets, but keep in mind there are still many limitations to the MathBox.</li>
