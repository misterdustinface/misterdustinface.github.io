[MathBox][] Available for Download

Download this [Text][] too.

When running MathBox, click "File" -> "Select Keyword Set"

Find the mathwords.txt file. 

Click it, then click "open".

The MathBox will grab the mathwords.txt file and scan it.

This will allow you to use a set of predefined keywords, and those keywords will be converted into other words or characters, as determined by the file.

Select the "Convert" option, or press the F1 key on your keyboard, to seamlessly convert keywords.

I called this MathBox because I used it to make my math homework easier to write on a computer.

You can make your own Keyword Sets, but keep in mind there are still many limitations to the MathBox.
